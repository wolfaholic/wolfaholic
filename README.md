🌟 Hello wonderful people! I am a person that is passionate about moving into a new career field that has been my dream career for a very long time 

🔥 ABOUT ME 🔥
I have a very customer-service rich employment history with a sprinkling of health care and sales in-between. I have always sought and found a way to influence each position I have held with empathy, passion and a never give up mind-frame. Never give up means to me that even when you are at your lowest, you pause and allow yourself a moment, then you get back up and persist. This frame of mind has helped me get through some of the lowest points in my life. The one thing though I always wanted though is to really make a difference and to work in an industry where I can as well as have a creative outlet. 

I have always had a interest in web development and design. I began to pursue my new career after having a health complication that left me at a crossroads. Following my motto, I picked myself up and persisted having decided to finally purse my dream job. I applied to a few different boot camps but settled on BloomTech (formerly Lambda) where I have gained the tools to and knowledge I would need to pursue my new career. I cannot wait to join a company and begin my new journey.
