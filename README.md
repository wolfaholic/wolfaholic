### Hello There, I am Melissa, ðŸ‘‹

Moving over from a long career of customer service, billing and retail. In 2019 I enrolled as a student at Lambda School learning full stack web development. I am currently set to earn my endorsement late 2022. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...my professional portfolio.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...React and reinforcing my knowledge of the fundamentals: CSS, HTML and JS.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...I am hoping that once I have a stronger confidence in my code that I can help and get in on an open source project or find a mentor to work with on a project that will help to reinforce my knowledge and help me grow as developer.

- I am always looking on new ways to grow and learn. I am simultaniously while I learn web development, self-teaching UI design. 

- I enjoy various hobbies that I look to blend in with my work, such as photography and graphic design. But I also enjoy writing short stories, reading, art of almost any kind. I enjoy being creative and I try to let that show through everything I do.
